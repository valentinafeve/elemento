In about 5000 BC, farmers settled on the fertile land of southern Mesopotamia known as Sumer,
and from these humble beginnings the world’s first great civilization formed.
Living along the river valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates
(Mesopotamia is Greek for the land ‘between two rivers’),
Sumerian farmers were able to grow an abundance of grain and other crops,
the surplus of which enabled them to settle in one place.
Sumerians also traded this surplus food for metals and tools with people as far away as present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan,
and they dug a network of ditches and canals as drainage channels on their fertile but flood-prone lands.

A Squash and a Squeeze
"Wise old man, won't you help me, please? My house is a squash and squeeze."
A little old lady lives all by herself in her house but she's not happy - it's just too small, even for one.
Whatever can she do? The wise old man knows: bring in a flappy, scratchy, greedy, noisy crowd of farmyard animals.
When she pushes them all out again, she'll be amazed at how big her house feels!

One day the pirate Modi was out running errands with his mom.
They shopped for groceries and ate peas at his favorite restaurant.
#Then the pirate Modi's mom said, "Oh yes, we need to stop off at the doctor's office for a quick checkup."
#The doctor checked Modi's heart, his blood pressure, and his knees.
#Then he explained that Modi would come back the next day and get a shot, to protect him from scurvy or something.
#The pirate Modi did not like shots.
#That evening his father came home and Modi told him all about the visit to the doctor.
#Modi's father said, "Modi, I know of something that can help you.
#Take this map and my fastest pirate ship and find it.
#Also, if you stay very still for the doctor you can have some ice cream."
#So Modi followed the map through the wildest seas,
#and climbed up volcanoes filled with fiery lava,
#and sneaked past creatures so terrible that they will not be described in this book,
#until he reached an icy castle at the top of the mountains.
#Inside, he found a great crab wizard on a crab wizard throne.
#The crab wizard spoke these words,
#"Monkey Pirate, because you have braved many obstacles to get here I will
#give you this rock. When you get a shot, you must squeeze the rock very
#tightly, and count to three. You will be magically taken into the future
#where the shot will be finished. Also, you can have some ice cream after."
#The pirate Modi thanked him and sailed back home to get some sleep.
#The next morning, he took the rock with him to the doctor's office.
#The doctor hummed a little song and filled up Modi's shot.
#Modi closed his eyes very tightly, squeezed the rock as hard as he could and counted 1, 2, 3!
#The crab wizard was right! The shot was finished.
#The Brave Monkey Pirate was now immune to scurvy and some other stuff.
#And he had ice cream on the way home.
#The end.

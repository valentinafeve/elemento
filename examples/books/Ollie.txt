Ollie is an eel, he likes his home in a jar.
When he comes out he swims over his jar.
He swims under his jar.
He swims through his jar.
He swims around his jar.
When he is done, he swims back into his jar.
Now there are two eels, Ollie and Izzy.
When Ollie and Izzy come out they can swim over, under, through, around, and back into their jar together.
